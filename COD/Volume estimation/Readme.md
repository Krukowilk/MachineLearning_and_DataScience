# Volume from atoms

In this small project, we would like to see, if it's possible to estimate unit cell (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cell) 
volume with only limited information.

## Why is this task not straightforward?
Arrangement of atoms in unit cell depends on multiple factors: number of atoms, atom types, bonds between atoms, symmetry ect.
It can even change for the same compound depending on temperature or pressure.


#### Here, we want to see to what extent volume can be predicted with increasing amount of information.
