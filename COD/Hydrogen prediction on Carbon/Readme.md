# Prediction of number of hydrogen atoms bonded to Carbon atoms

As title of this project says, I'll try to predict if carbon atom have hydrogens, and if yes - estimate how many. 
I'll use ~1700 structures containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms. If I succeed in such approach, I'll expand training set to contain also different atoms (but still, prediction is targeted for carbon at the moment).

## Why would I predict such information?

This project is the first step to more advanced predictions, and hydrogens bonded to carbon atoms in most cases follow straightforward rules. 
Limiting to only these atom types allows for simplification of the model.
