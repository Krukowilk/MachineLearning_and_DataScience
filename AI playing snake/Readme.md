# AI playing snake
The purpose of this small project is to train AI to play classical "snake" game.

### Snake game
The "regular" game was written in pygame module. User can steer with arrows and w, s, a, d keys.

### Machine learning model
I based the model on *vedantgoswami* project (https://github.com/vedantgoswami/SnakeGameAI).
In current version ML side is almost identical with this project. My intention is to rewrite it and adjust to my desired specifications.
